abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The underground environment imposes unique demands on life that have led subterranean species to evolve specialized traits, many of which evolved convergently. We studied convergence in evolutionary rate in subterranean mammals in order to associate phenotypic evolution with specific genetic regions. We identified a strong excess of vision- and skin-related genes that changed at accelerated rates in the subterranean environment due to relaxed constraint and adaptive evolution. We also demonstrate that ocular-specific transcriptional enhancers were convergently accelerated, whereas enhancers active outside the eye were not. Furthermore, several uncharacterized genes and regulatory sequences demonstrated convergence and thus constitute novel candidate sequences for congenital ocular disorders. The strong evidence of convergence in these species indicates that evolution in this environment is recurrent and predictable and can be used to gain insights into phenotypeâ€“genotype relationships.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Chikina2016,
abstract = {Mammal species have made the transition to the marine environment several times, and their lineages represent one of the classical examples of convergent evolution in morphological and physiological traits. Nevertheless, the genetic mechanisms of their phenotypic transition are poorly understood, and investigations into convergence at the molecular level have been inconclusive. While past studies have searched for convergent changes at specific amino acid sites, we propose an alternative strategy to identify those genes that experienced convergent changes in their selective pressures, visible as changes in evolutionary rate specifically in the marine lineages. We present evidence of widespread convergence at the gene level by identifying parallel shifts in evolutionary rate during three independent episodes of mammalian adaptation to the marine environment. Hundreds of genes accelerated their evolutionary rates in all three marine mammal lineages during their transition to aquatic life. These marine-accelerated genes are highly enriched for pathways that control recognized functional adaptations in marine mammals, including muscle physiology, lipid-metabolism, sensory systems, and skin and connective tissue. The accelerations resulted from both adaptive evolution as seen in skin and lung genes, and loss of function as in gustatory and olfactory genes. In regard to sensory systems, this finding provides further evidence that reduced senses of taste and smell are ubiquitous in marine mammals. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of identifying genes underlying convergent organism-level characteristics on a genome-wide scale and without prior knowledge of adaptations, and provides a powerful approach for investigating the physiological functions of mammalian genes.},

Previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models. Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data and performing congruence analyses.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Meyer2018,
abstract = {Mammals diversified by colonizing drastically different environments, with each transition yielding numerous molecular changes, including losses of protein function. Though not initially deleterious, these losses could subsequently carry deleterious pleiotropic consequences. We have used phylogenetic methods to identify convergent functional losses across independent marine mammal lineages. In one extreme case, Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) accrued lesions in all marine lineages, while remaining intact in all terrestrial mammals. These lesions coincide with PON1 enzymatic activity loss in marine species' blood plasma. This convergent loss is likely explained by parallel shifts in marine ancestors' lipid metabolism and/or bloodstream oxidative environment affecting PON1's role in fatty acid oxidation. PON1 loss also eliminates marine mammals' main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern environments.},

	abstract = {Identifying genomic elements underlying phenotypic adaptations is an important problem in evolutionary biology. Comparative analyses learning from convergent evolution of traits are gaining momentum in accurately detecting such elements. We previously developed a method for predicting phenotypic associations of genetic elements by contrasting patterns of sequence evolution in species showing a phenotype with those that do not. Using this method, we successfully demonstrated convergent evolutionary rate shifts in genetic elements associated with two phenotypic adaptations, namely the independent subterranean and marine transitions of terrestrial mammalian lineages. Our method calculates gene-specific rates of evolution on branches of phylogenetic trees using linear regression. These rates represent the extent of sequence divergence on a branch after removing the expected divergence on the branch due to background factors. The rates calculated using this regression analysis exhibit an important statistical limitation, namely heteroscedasticity. We observe that the rates on branches that are longer on average show higher variance, and describe how this problem adversely affects the confidence with which we can make inferences about rate shifts. Using a combination of data transformation and weighted regression, we have developed an updated method that corrects this heteroscedasticity in the rates. We additionally illustrate the improved performance offered by the updated method at robust detection of convergent rate shifts in phylogenetic trees of protein-coding genes across mammals, as well as using simulated tree datasets. Overall, we present an important extension to our evolutionary-rates-based method that performs more robustly and consistently at detecting convergent shifts in evolutionary rates.},
