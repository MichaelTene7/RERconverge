## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## My own work

Attempting to load and plot RER data.

```{r, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
library("RERconverge")
data("toyTrees") 
data("mamRERw")
repopath = "~/Documents/Github/RERconverge"
source(paste(repopath,"/R/RERfuncs.R",sep=""))
source(paste(repopath,"/R/plottingFuncs.R",sep="")) #for troubleshooting margins
```

Here is where I have issues with figure margins.

```{r fig2c, fig.height=9,fig.width=10, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
#plot RERs as tree
#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
newbend3rers = treePlotRers(treesObj=toyTrees, rermat=mamRERw, index="BEND3", 
                            type="c", nlevels=9, figwid=10)
#treePlotRers(treesObj=toyTrees, rermat=mamRERw, index="BEND3", type="c", nlevels=9)
```
